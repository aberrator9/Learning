Hello! I'm Justin, and this repository tracks my learning and professional development as I transition from games (Unity, Godot) into .NET development. I'm doing this for a few reasons, but primarily to become a better, more well-rounded software developer. I love learning and solving interesting problems, so from my perspective, it feels like a natural move.

# Things I know
- I've created a lot of prototypes, shipped and supported two free games at https://aberrator.itch.io, and worked as a contractor for an educational games company.
- I have an intermediate knowledge of C# and SQL, and am familiar with JS and Python.
- I understand OOP and basic software design patterns, and have been working to undo the bad habits foisted upon me as a Unity developer (lol).

# Progress
Check out my public Trello board here for my overall roadmap:

I'm also re-teaching myself proper typing in order to increase my speed. I maxed out around 80 wpm by my previous, semi-random method. Now, with proper form, I am already up to about 60 wpm, and I expect that to continue rising for a while.

# Current study / goals
- [10%] Data Structures and Algorithms: https://frontendmasters.com/courses/algorithms/
- [60%] Microsoft Visual C# 2013 Step by Step (John Sharp, book)
- [Not started] Professional ASP.NET MVC 4 (Jon Galloway, Phil Haack, book)

- Create ASP.NET CRUD app
- Create WPF Todo List app

Thanks for checking out the repo! I will be adding practice projects as I come up with and complete them, as well as hopefully editing this readme to be more interactive and automated :)
