# Things I learned
- How to build Winforms app
- How to use timers, event handlers

# What could be fixed, expanded on
- Timers don't keep perfect time, so time in this application may drift; okay as a proof of concept.
- "toggle" is too ambiguous a name for the start / stop button, considering there is a separate button for switching modes that could theoretically be named "toggle" as well. Suggest "startStopButton."
- Could add flashing colon every half second, like on a digital clock.
- Could add alarm sound, start / stop sound to improve accessibility, functionality.
